# Threat Detect

This Python script allows you to scan a URL for malware using the VirusTotal API. After scanning, the script generates a detailed report on the scan results and opens it in your default web browser.

To use the script, you need to get your API key from the VirusTotal website and insert it into the API_KEY variable in the script. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the URL you want to scan. Once the scan is complete, you will be asked if you want to scan another URL.

To run the script, simply execute the `main()` function. The script has been released under the MIT license.

## How to Use

1.  Get an API key from VirusTotal website
2.  Install `requests` module using `pip install requests`
3.  Set the API key in `API_KEY` variable in the script.
4.  Execute the script `python thread_detect.py`
